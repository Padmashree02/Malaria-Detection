**Introduction**

- Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals . Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma or death.

- Malaria must be recognized promptly in order to treat the patient in time and to prevent further spread of infection in the community via local mosquitoes.

**Machine Learning approach**

- Using Clinical diagnosis data set i.e. based on patients symptoms data set we can detect malaria . We can use different  classification ML algorithms for it. e.g. K-means, logistic regression, SVM etc.

- Using microscopic slide of blood smears i.e. using infected cell image data set we can detect malaria by applying  machine learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) which automatically classifies and predicts infected cells in thin blood smears on standard microscope slides.
